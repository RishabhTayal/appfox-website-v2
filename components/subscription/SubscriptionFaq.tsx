  {
    q: "Is AppFox Subscription really free?",
    a: "Yes - free to install and free to run, with no monthly fee, no per-subscriber charge, and no cap on subscriptions. It works on every Shopify plan.",
  },
  {
    q: "Does it use Shopify's native checkout?",
    a: "Yes. Subscriptions are created and billed through Shopify Checkout and Shopify's native subscription APIs - customers pay on the same checkout they already trust, and recurring charges renew automatically on the schedule they picked.",
  },
  {
    q: "What kinds of subscriptions can I offer?",
    a: "Replenishment (subscribe-and-save), curated subscription boxes, memberships and access subscriptions, digital products, services, and product bundles - with fixed, tiered, or trial-period pricing. If it recurs, you can model it.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can customers manage their own subscriptions?",
    a: "Yes. The customer portal lets subscribers skip a delivery, pause, swap products, change frequency, update payment details, or cancel - on their own, from their account. Most \"about my subscription\" emails never get sent.",
  },
  {
    q: "Wasn't this app called Trust Subscriptions?",
    a: "Same app, new name. Trust Subscriptions joined the AppFox family and is now AppFox Subscription - existing merchants, subscriptions, and settings carry over unchanged, and the app keeps its App Store review history.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I migrate from another subscription app?",
    a: "Yes. You can bring existing subscribers over from apps like Recharge, and support will help with the move - reach out before you switch and we'll walk through it together.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to touch my theme code?",
    a: "No. The subscription widget drops onto your product pages from the app - pick a template, match your branding, and publish. Setup takes about five minutes, and it also works with PageFly pages.",
  },
